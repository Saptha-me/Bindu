# üåå The Idea

Integration was the problem.
And even today, it still is.

We built monoliths, then <b>APIs</b>, then <b>microservices</b>, then <b>cloud functions</b>.<br/>
Each step made systems faster, smaller, and more distributed.

Then, on <b>30th November 2022</b>, something changed.<br/>
We entered the age of <b>Large Language Models</b>.<br/>
Software began reasoning, planning, and calling tools.<br/>
Suddenly, our code didn‚Äôt just execute, it <b>thought</b>.

But the old problem stayed the same.<br/>
<b>Connection.</b>

Now we have the language protocols for this new world:<br/>
[A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A), [AP2](https://github.com/google-agentic-commerce/AP2), and [X402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402) ‚Äî ways for agents to talk, trust, and trade.<br/>

Yet, connecting them still takes time, code, and complexity.

That‚Äôs why <b>Bindu exists.</b>

<b>Bindu</b> is a Python package that turns your agent into a <b>living server</b>.One that can speak the language of <b>A2A, AP2, and X402</b>,
And communicate with other agents and microservices across the open web.

Just write your agent in any framework you like, then use <b>Bindu</b>.
it will <b>Bindu-fy</b> your agent so that it can instantly join the Internet of Agents.


## Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add bindu
```


## üöÄ Quick Start

### Quick Start with Cookiecutter Template

The fastest way to get started with bindu is using our cookiecutter template:

```bash
# Create a new bindu project
uv tool run cookiecutter cookiecutter-bindu/
```

That‚Äôs it.
Your local agent becomes a live, secure, discoverable service, ready to talk with other agents anywhere.

### Manual Setup - Create Your First Agent

**Step 1:** Create a configuration file `agent_config.json`:

```json
{
  "author": "your.email@example.com",
  "name": "my_first_agent",
  "description": "A simple agent that answers questions",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "deployment": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8030",
    "expose": true
  }
}
```
Full Detailed Configuration can be found [here](https://docs.saptha.me).

**Step 2:** Create your agent script `my_agent.py`:

```python
from bindu import bindufy

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy


# Load configuration
def load_config(config_path: str):
    """Load configuration from JSON with defaults."""
    full_path = os.path.join(config_path)
    with open(full_path, "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)


simple_config = load_config("simple_agent_config.json")
simple_agent = Agent(
    instructions="Provide helpful responses to user messages",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
)

def simple_handler(messages: list[dict[str, str]]) -> Any:
    result = simple_agent.run(input=messages)
    return result

bindufy(simple_agent, simple_config, simple_handler)
```

That's it! Your agent is now live at `http://localhost:8030` and ready to communicate with other agents.

```

Each symbol is an agent ‚Äî a spark of intelligence.
And the single tiny dot is Bindu, the origin point in the Internet of Agents.<br/>



# The Saptha.me Connection

Saptha.me is the layer that makes swarms of agents.

In this swarm, each Bindu is a dot - annotating agents with the shared language of A2A, AP2, and X402.

Agents can be hosted anywhere ‚Äî on laptops, clouds, or clusters ‚Äî yet speak the same protocol, trust each other by design,
and work together as a single, distributed mind.

Saptha gives them the seven layers of connection ‚Äî mind, memory, trust, task, identity, value, and flow ‚Äî
that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called Saptha.me.
(Saptha, meaning ‚Äúseven‚Äù; me, the self-aware network.)



## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Agent Frameworks

Bindu is Agent Framework agnostic.

We did test with mainly Agno, CrewAI, LangChain, and LlamaIndex, FastAgent.
