"""MIDDLEWARE MODULE EXPORTS.

This module provides middleware layers for the bindu framework including
authentication and payment protocol enforcement.

MIDDLEWARE STRUCTURE:

1. AUTHENTICATION MIDDLEWARE (auth/):
   - AuthMiddleware: Abstract base class for authentication
   - Auth0Middleware: Auth0 JWT validation (production-ready)
   - CognitoMiddleware: AWS Cognito JWT validation (template)

2. PAYMENT MIDDLEWARE (x402/):
   - X402Middleware: x402 payment protocol enforcement
     Automatically handles payment verification and settlement for agents
     with execution_cost configured.

USAGE PATTERNS:
   - Import the base AuthMiddleware class for type hints and interfaces
   - Import specific implementations based on your auth provider
   - Import X402Middleware for payment-gated agents
   - All implementations are interchangeable through their base interfaces
"""

from __future__ import annotations as _annotations

# Export authentication implementations from auth/ subdirectory
from .auth import Auth0Middleware, AuthMiddleware, CognitoMiddleware

# Export payment middleware from x402/ subdirectory
from .x402 import X402Middleware

__all__ = [
    # Base interface
    "AuthMiddleware",
    # Authentication implementations
    "Auth0Middleware",
    "CognitoMiddleware",
    # Payment middleware
    "X402Middleware",
