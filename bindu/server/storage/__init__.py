# STORAGE MODULE EXPORTS:
#
# This module provides the storage layer for the bindu framework.
# It exposes different storage implementations for tasks and contexts.
#
# BURGER STORE ANALOGY:
#
# Think of this as the restaurant's order management system catalog:
#
# 1. STORAGE INTERFACE (Storage):
#    - Abstract base class defining the storage contract
#    - All storage implementations must follow this interface
#    - Ensures consistent API across different storage backends
#
# 2. STORAGE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
#    - InMemoryStorage: Fast whiteboard system (development/testing)
#    - PostgreSQLStorage: Enterprise database system (production)
#
# 3. USAGE PATTERNS:
#    - Import the base Storage class for type hints and interfaces
#    - Import specific implementations based on your needs
#    - All implementations are interchangeable through the Storage interface
#
# AVAILABLE STORAGE OPTIONS:
# - InMemoryStorage: Lightning-fast temporary storage
# - PostgreSQLStorage: ACID-compliant persistent storage with ORM
#
#  Thank you users! We ‚ù§Ô∏è you! - üêß
