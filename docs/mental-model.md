# Bindu – Mental Model for Beginners

## What problem does Bindu solve?

Most AI agents today work in isolation.
Each agent repeatedly rebuilds:
- identity
- communication
- payment handling

Bindu provides these as a shared infrastructure layer.

## What is Bindu conceptually?

Bindu gives every agent:
- a passport (decentralized identity)
- a phone number (agent-to-agent communication)
- a wallet (optional payments)

This allows agents to trust, talk, and collaborate.

## What Bindu is NOT

- Not an LLM framework
- Not an agent logic engine
- Not a replacement for existing agents

Bindu wraps around agents rather than replacing them.

## High-level flow

1. Existing agent is "bindified"
2. Bindu assigns a decentralized identity (DID)
3. Agent becomes discoverable
4. Other agents or users can interact
5. Optional value exchange via payments
