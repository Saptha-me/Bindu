  overview: |
    This agent specializes in PDF document processing with support for text extraction,
    form filling, and table extraction. It handles both standard text-based PDFs and
    scanned documents (with OCR).

    The agent uses industry-standard libraries (pypdf, pdfplumber) and provides
    reliable, consistent results for various PDF processing tasks.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - User uploads a PDF and asks to extract text
      - User needs to fill out PDF forms programmatically
      - User wants to extract tables from reports/invoices
      - User needs to process scanned documents
      - User wants to parse structured data from PDFs

    when_not_to_use:
      - PDF editing or modification (use pdf-editor agent)
      - PDF creation from scratch (use pdf-generator agent)
      - Image extraction from PDFs (use pdf-image-extractor agent)
      - PDF merging/splitting (use pdf-manipulator agent)
      - Real-time PDF streaming (not supported)

  error_handling:
    - "Encrypted PDFs: Returns error requesting password with clear message"
    - "Corrupted files: Returns validation error with details about corruption"
    - "Unsupported operations: Returns clear error message with alternatives"
    - "Timeout: 30 seconds per page, returns partial results if timeout occurs"
    - "OCR failures: Falls back to standard extraction, reports OCR unavailable"
    - "Memory limits: Rejects files that exceed memory constraints"

  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Check file size before processing (max 50MB)"
      - "Use OCR only when necessary (3-5x slower than standard extraction)"
      - "Validate form data types before filling"
      - "Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages"
      - "Consider pagination for large documents"
      - "Cache results for frequently accessed documents"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route PDF operations based on operation type (extract/fill/parse)"
      - "Check tesseract-ocr availability before routing OCR requests"
      - "Consider file size for performance estimation (2s per page average)"
      - "Chain with text-analysis for content understanding"
      - "Use performance metrics for load balancing across instances"
      - "Implement retry logic for timeout scenarios"
      - "Monitor memory usage for concurrent requests"
