  overview: |
    This skill enables the agent to answer a wide range of questions using reasoning
    and knowledge retrieval. It's designed for general-purpose question answering
    across various domains including science, history, technology, and everyday topics.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - User asks a direct factual question
      - User needs an explanation of a concept
      - User wants to understand how something works
      - User requests information about historical events, scientific facts, or general knowledge
      - User needs help understanding a topic

    when_not_to_use:
      - Real-time information (use web-search skill)
      - Personal data or user-specific information (use context-retrieval skill)
      - Complex calculations (use calculator skill)
      - Code generation (use code-assistant skill)
      - Document processing (use document-analysis skill)

  input_structure: |
    Accepts natural language questions in plain text or structured format:

    Plain text:
    "What is photosynthesis?"

    Structured JSON:
    {
      "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
      "context": "optional context or constraints",
      "detail_level": "brief|detailed|comprehensive"
    }

  output_format: |
    Standard response (JSON):
    {
      "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants...",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "sources": ["general_knowledge"],
      "follow_up_suggestions": [
        "Would you like to know about the chemical equation?",
        "Interested in learning about different types of photosynthesis?"
      ]
    }

    Brief response (text/plain):
    "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy..."

  quality_guidelines:
    - "Accuracy: Prioritize factual correctness"
    - "Clarity: Use clear, understandable language"
    - "Completeness: Address all aspects of the question"
    - "Conciseness: Be thorough but not verbose"
    - "Honesty: Acknowledge uncertainty when appropriate"

  error_handling:
    - "Ambiguous questions: Ask for clarification"
    - "Out of scope: Politely indicate limitations"
    - "Insufficient information: Request additional context"
    - "Controversial topics: Present balanced perspectives"

  examples:
    - title: "Simple Factual Question"
      input: "What is the capital of France?"
      output:
        answer: "The capital of France is Paris."
        confidence: 1.0
        sources: ["general_knowledge"]

    - title: "Explanation Request"
      input:
        question: "How does a refrigerator work?"
        detail_level: "detailed"
      output:
        answer: |
          A refrigerator works by using a refrigeration cycle to remove heat from its interior...

          1. Compression: The compressor pressurizes refrigerant gas...
          2. Condensation: The hot gas flows through condenser coils...
          3. Expansion: The liquid refrigerant passes through an expansion valve...
          4. Evaporation: The cold refrigerant absorbs heat from the interior...
        confidence: 0.92
        sources: ["general_knowledge", "physics"]
        follow_up_suggestions:
          - "Would you like to know about different types of refrigerants?"
          - "Interested in energy efficiency tips for refrigerators?"

    - title: "Complex Reasoning"
      input: "Why do we see different phases of the moon?"
      output:
        answer: |
          We see different phases of the moon because of the changing positions of the Moon,
          Earth, and Sun. As the Moon orbits Earth, the amount of its sunlit surface visible
          from Earth varies:

          - New Moon: Moon is between Earth and Sun (dark side faces us)
          - First Quarter: Moon is 90° from the Sun (half illuminated)
          - Full Moon: Earth is between Moon and Sun (fully illuminated)
          - Last Quarter: Moon is 270° from the Sun (half illuminated)

          The cycle takes about 29.5 days to complete.
        confidence: 0.96

  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Provide clear questions in natural language"
      - "Include context when available"
      - "Specify desired detail level"
      - "Handle follow-up questions in conversation flow"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route factual questions to this skill"
      - "Chain with web-search for real-time information"
      - "Combine with document-analysis for context-aware answers"
      - "Use confidence scores for answer validation"
      - "Consider caching common questions for performance"
